  - Site visit – Verify vegetation/slope, access and water supply (photos &
    measurements)

faq:
  - q: Do I need a BMP?
    a: Often required for subdivisions, grouped/multiple dwellings,
      vulnerable/critical uses or where council/DFES conditions specify it. A
      BMP sets out how the proposal meets SPP 3.7 via BPC A–D.
  - q: What’s the difference between a BAL and a BMP?
    a: A BAL is the hazard rating used for construction. A BMP is a full strategy
      and report (mapping, APZ, access, water, BPC A–D) to support
      planning/building approval.
  - q: What do you need from me to start?
    a: Site address/lot details, proposed drawings (site/ground/floor), services
      plan (if any) and target timeframe; any previous fire reports or
      conditions are helpful.
  - q: How long will it take?
    a: Usually 5–10 business days from the site visit; urgent turnarounds available
      on request.
  - q: Will you liaise with council/DFES?
    a: Yes—our fee includes one written response to RFI. Additional rounds or
      meetings can be added if needed.
  - q: Is a site visit required?
    a: In all cases yes, to verify vegetation and slope. Desktop-only is possible
      for limited, well-documented scenarios.
